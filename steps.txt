1. First i strted by creating a landing page 
2. writing some react and csss
3. the main part comes with making the login page 
Started mking Route by react Router dom
made different login and signup pages
after successsfully started making routes to the login and register pages 
i started connecting the backend sefrvices to register a user 
for that i used express 
created a registration form which include name email and pass
created the api index.js
in registerpage created a function to handle registrai=tion
which uses axios to connect to backend as a XMl htttp request
Here we use axios.post to use the information provided by user to our backend
then at the backend in index.js used cors (to collect the information )
coming from the frontend
Set the credentials as true and add the origin of your frontend url
this will create a connection between your front and back end
make a app.post to handle the register yser here create a user
MAke a mongoose connection
did this by mongoose atlas generating a string then connecting it heree
make a model of user in which write the userSchema
put the generated string in the dotenv file 
include name , emqil , password ,
export this schema model then use it in app.post as User.create to register a new user
now password will come as a string so we have to use bcrypt
